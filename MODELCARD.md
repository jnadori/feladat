# Model Card



## Model Details

Logistic regression to predict whether a person makes over 50k a year or not.

## Intended Use

One time use for a learning project.

## Training Data

1994 Census database was split into 80% training data.

## Evaluation Data

1994 Census database was split into20 % test data.

## Metrics

Validates the trained machine learning model using precision, recall, and F1.
Performance: \
precision = 0.7285\
recall= 0.2699\
F1= 0.3938

## Ethical Considerations

Consider, that the model trained on a dataset from 1994, it makes its predictions about races ethically questionable due to historical reasons.

## Caveats and Recommendations

It is recommended to try out some models, other than LR.
